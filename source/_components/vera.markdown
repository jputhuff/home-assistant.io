The [Vera](http://getvera.com) hub is a controller mainly connecting to Z-Wave devices.

Switches, lights (incl. dimmers), sensors and binary sensors are supported and will be automaticaly added when HA connects to your Vera controller.

To use Vera devices in your installation, add the following to your configuration.yaml file using the IP and port number of your Vera controller:

```yaml
vera:
  vera_controller_url: http://192.168.1.161:3480/
```

By default your switches will be added to HA as switches. However if some of them are light switches, you can tell HA this using the optional ```lights``` parameter as shown below.

Vera imports detailed zwave devices into HA. This can include system devices and other devices that you don't use; you can tell HA not to load these devices using the ```exclude:``` parameter as shown below.

You can find the Vera device id either by looking at your Vera controller or by checking the ```Vera Device Id``` attribute on each device imported into HA.

```yaml
vera:
  vera_controller_url: http://192.168.1.161:3480/
  # Optional to exclude devices - this is a list of vera device ids
  exclude: [ 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 88, 89, 99]
  # Optional to import switches as lights - this is a list of vera device ids
  lights: [15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 43, 64, 70, 87]
```
